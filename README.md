- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
-->I loaned my roommate, who I had known for over 38 years, my phone until she could replace hers.  After that I received a message ( do not remember if it was a  text or email) that had a few audio seconds of a conversation that had been recorded from my phones mic. I had not been on my phone when it was recorded. 

After that I received phishing text and emails from my own email accounts. Next, every password for every email, social media, and website account had been changed and I was locked out. 

I have been CONSTANYLY harassed and threanted via text and email that would disappear? I believe she is using my ID to send phishing and other fraudulent emails. 
She took over my Facebook account and had it deleted. I had owned that ID for over eleven years. It had my mother's memorial page attached to it. 
This harassment has been going on for almost two years and causes me great stress, my health has suffered, and I just want to find how she did it
